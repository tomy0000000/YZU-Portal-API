# YZU-Portal-SDK
A Python SDK for accessing [YZU Portal System](https://portalx.yzu.edu.tw)

# Introduction
This is a minimum viable product I developed to fulfilled my needs of task management and learning Python at the same time.

Therefore, most of the codes were written in non-mature, dis-Pythonic way.

Also, since I've left YZU, this project is now permentaly abandoned, but if you're interested in any part of this repo, please don't hesitate to submit issue, I'll try my best to help you make it works.

# Usage

See [`Demo.ipynb`](./Demo.ipynb)
